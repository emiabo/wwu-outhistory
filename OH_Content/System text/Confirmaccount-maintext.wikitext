'''This page is used to confirm pending account requests at ''{{SITENAME}}'''''.

Each account request queue consists of three subqueues.
One for open request, one for those that have been put on hold by other administrators pending further information, and another for recently rejected requests.
When responding to a request, carefully review it and, if needed, confirm the information contain therein.

If an approved user needs to edit, don't forget to assign them to the Contributor group at [[Special:UserRights]]!
